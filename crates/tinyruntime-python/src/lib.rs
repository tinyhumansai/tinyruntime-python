//! The Python runtime provider for tinyruntime.
//!
//! # What this crate is
//!
//! One half of a deliberate split. `tinyruntime` — the router — owns everything
//! that is the same for every language: downloading an archive, verifying its
//! digest, unpacking it, promoting it into a cache atomically, reusing it on the
//! next start, and keeping a bounded set of warm interpreter processes in front
//! of it. This crate owns everything that is true only of Python:
//!
//! - [`version`] — that a Python request names a *floor* rather than an exact
//!   version, because that is what its distribution channel actually supports.
//! - [`system`] — how to find a host interpreter, and why `python3.12` is tried
//!   before `python3`.
//! - [`distribution`] — how to search a moving release index for the newest build
//!   inside the requested range, and why a stripped build wins a tie.
//! - [`layout`] — that a standalone build hides its interpreter under `python/`,
//!   whatever version it is.
//! - [`harness`](mod@harness) — what a warm Python worker is, and the two things it cannot
//!   promise that the Node one can.
//!
//! It downloads nothing, installs nothing, and starts no worker. Every answer it
//! gives is a description the router acts on.
//!
//! # A note on isolation
//!
//! Python cannot isolate a pooled job the way JavaScript can: there is no worker
//! thread to run it in and no safe way to kill one. Jobs on a warm Python worker
//! share module state, `os.environ`, and logging configuration. The harness
//! gives each job fresh globals and the router recycles workers after a job
//! budget, which bounds the leakage without eliminating it — which is why a host
//! opts into Python pooling rather than getting it by default.
//!
//! # Using it
//!
//! Load it alongside `tinyruntime`, which routes `python` to the well-known name
//! this module claims. A host then asks the router to run Python and never
//! addresses this module directly.
//!
//! ```
//! use tinyruntime_python::{DEFAULT_VERSION, parse_version, satisfies};
//!
//! // A request names a floor, so a newer interpreter satisfies it.
//! let installed = parse_version("Python 3.13.1").expect("a version");
//! assert!(satisfies(installed, DEFAULT_VERSION, None));
//! assert!(!satisfies(installed, DEFAULT_VERSION, Some("3.13")));
//! ```
